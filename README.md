## Instructions

This is a memory game inspired by super mario world (despite having the power wing of super mario 3).

Beat the game by hitting all the combinations and challenge yourself to get 3 stars in the shortest possible time. Or use the reload button to restart the game.

## Dependencies

* [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) - a bunch of cool, fun, and cross-browser animations
* [Super Mario 256](https://www.dafont.com/pt/super-mario-256.font) - Font: almost an exact replica of the mario letters
